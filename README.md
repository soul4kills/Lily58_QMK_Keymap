Trackball Functionality

    Non-linear scaling for cursor movement
    Makes cursor control more usable compared to linear motion. (Borrowed idea from idank’s custom keymaps.)

    Scrolling Emulation & Arrow Key Emulation

        Single press of trackball ⇢ enables Scrolling mode.

        Double press of trackball ⇢ enables Arrow key mode.

        Modes are per-side, so you can mix functions (e.g., left for scrolling, right for pointer movement).

        RGB feedback is mirrored on the opposite side (useful since your finger covers the active trackball).

    Contextual Mouse Buttons

        When mouse movement is detected, the R, T, Y, U keys temporarily map to mouse buttons (MB1/MB2).

        These mappings expire after a set timeout for automatic reset.

RGB Syncing

    Master board syncs RGB state with the slave.

    Used as an indicator for trackball modes and layer states.

Layer Management

    4 custom layer-hold keys added.

    Holding them accesses layers 1, 2, and 3.

    Purpose: Moving layer-change keys from the two inner space keys → second inner space keys.

        More comfortable for gaming (thumb closer in).

        Normal typing feels better with layer keys slightly farther out.

Personal Opinion

    At first the board was frustrating—trackballs and stock behavior made it really difficult to use. I put it away after a month with disappointment after purchase.

    Brought it back out a week ago and took another stab at it since I have a better understanding of code now.  

    Now with some coding knowledge at hand, I'm was able to put together a firmware to allow the keyboard to be a lot more useful and usable.

    AI helped with code brainstorming, even if it wasn’t copy-paste ready.

    Gaming is trickier: the linear column layout puts certain keys (like the one above W) in awkward spots when fingers are anchored. Likely fixed with a dedicated gaming layer.
